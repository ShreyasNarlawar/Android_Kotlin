When using var, you can change the value whenever you want.

The val keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

OOP helps to keep the Kotlin code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself".

Use the open keyword in front of the superclass/parent, to make this the class other classes should inherit properties and functions from.

To inherit from a class, specify the name of the subclass, followed by a colon :, and then the name of the superclass.
